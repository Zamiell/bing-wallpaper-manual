`bing-wallpaper-manual` is a script that emulates the functionality of the [Bing Wallpaper](https://www.bing.com/apps/wallpaper) application for Windows. All this script does is use the Bing API to find the latest photo for the day and then set it to be the current wallpaper. (The photos rotate every night at 12 AM PST.)
